**Coding Description for Bioinformatics Role: TRUST4 Pipeline
Implementation**

### **Objective**: Implement the TRUST4 (TCR and BCR Repertoire Utilities for Solid Tissue) pipeline to analyze immune repertoires in cancer samples. This exercise aims to assess coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and understanding of high level immunogenomics concepts.

Task Overview:

1.  Implement the TRUST4 pipeline
    ([[https://github.com/liulab-dfci/TRUST4]{.underline}](https://github.com/liulab-dfci/TRUST4))

2.  Identify and select 2-3 cancer samples with available
    immunophenotyping data (hot or cold tumor)

3.  Run the pipeline on the selected samples

4.  Report your code and high-level results

Detailed Instructions:

1.  TRUST4 Pipeline Implementation:

    -   Familiarize yourself with the TRUST4 tool and its requirements

    -   Set up the necessary environment and dependencies (e.g., using
        conda or docker)

    -   Implement a workflow to run TRUST4 on multiple samples

2.  Sample Selection:

    -   Choose 2-3 cancer samples with available RNA-seq data and known
        immunophenotyping status (hot or cold tumor)

    -   Samples can be obtained from public repositories like The Cancer
        Genome Atlas (TCGA) or Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)

3.  Pipeline Execution:

    -   Run the TRUST4 pipeline on your selected samples

    -   Ensure proper input formatting and parameter settings

    -   Document any modifications or additional steps you implement

4.  Deliverables:\
    Code:

    -   Provide well-commented, readable code for your implementation

    -   Include any scripts for data preprocessing, pipeline execution,
        and result analysis

    -   Use version control (e.g., git) and share a link to your
        repository

5.  Challenges and Solutions:

    -   Describe any specific challenges encountered during the
        implementation

    -   Explain how you addressed these challenges

6.  Results Summary:

    -   Provide a very high-level explanation of the output

    -   Discuss whether the results are consistent across samples and
        with expected outcomes

    -   Include basic visualizations if applicable (e.g., clonotype
        diversity, V/J gene usage)

7.  Quality Control:

    -   Explain how you assess the quality of the results and process

    -   Describe any QC metrics or checks you implemented

    -   Discuss how you would validate the reliability of the output

Additional Guidelines:

-   Use best practices for reproducible research (e.g., environment
    management, documentation)

-   You may use additional tools or packages as needed, but justify
    their use
